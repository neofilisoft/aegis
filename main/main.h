	 * Consists of several methods that are called by each platform's specific main(argc, argv).
	 * To fully understand engine init, one should therefore start from the platform's main and
	 * see how it calls into the Main class' methods.
	 *
	 * The initialization is typically done in 3 steps (with the setup2 step triggered either
	 * automatically by setup, or manually in the platform's main).
	 *
	 * - setup(execpath, argc, argv, p_second_phase) is the main entry point for all platforms,
	 *   responsible for the initialization of all low level singletons and core types, and parsing
	 *   command line arguments to configure things accordingly.
	 *   If p_second_phase is true, it will chain into setup2() (default behavior). This is
	 *   disabled on some platforms (Android, iOS) which trigger the second step in their own time.
	 *
	 * - setup2(p_main_tid_override) registers high level servers and singletons, displays the
	 *   boot splash, then registers higher level types (scene, editor, etc.).
	 *
	 * - start() is the last step and that's where command line tools can run, or the main loop
	 *   can be created eventually and the project settings put into action. That's also where
	 *   the editor node is created, if relevant.
	 *   start() does it own argument parsing for a subset of the command line arguments described
	 *   in help, it's a bit messy and should be globalized with the setup() parsing somehow.
